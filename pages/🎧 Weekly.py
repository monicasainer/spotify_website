            -I follow an irregular path ü§™:

                Even though I listened to 125 artists per week in average, the data can change drastically
                from one week to another.
                This irregular pattern can be applied to the number of minutes listened too.

            -I started the year with variety üîÅ :

                In spite of lower levels of minutes played compared to the central and ending weeks of the year,
                I kept exploring different artists.
                However, at the end of the year I prefered to listened to either the same tracks or
                the same artists' songs.

            -Gradual increase and decrease üöÄ:

                It seems that the number of minutes listened increase gradually during the first weeks,
                to reach the maximum during the central weeks of the year.
                However, the graphs in the section Monthly will clarify this assumption.
